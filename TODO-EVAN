- Pretty much all quests from 22579+ need to be checked. The QRs get confusing as is how the cave itself functions. A modern MS video is available on youtube that plays through the entire Evan story.
  There may not be enough available information to make these quests 100% v95-like as there seems to be SOME changes in Evan's story between v95 and modern MS (which isn't surprising whatsoever.)
